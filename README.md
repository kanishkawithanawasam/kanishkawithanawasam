# Hi there 👋 , I am Kanishka Withanawasam and welcome to my GitHub Profile

## Little about me

I am a final-year BSc Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Nottingham, with a strong passion for solving real-world problems through software engineering and AI/ML. My academic journey and hands-on experience have equipped me with the ability to design and develop innovative solutions that deliver meaningful impact.

I enjoy building scalable distributed systems, exploring full-stack technologies, and contributing to open-source projects. I am driven by a desire to continuously learn, apply my skills in dynamic environments, and collaborate with others to create high-quality software.
